Ryan spent 13.5 years with IBM principally involved in GNU Toolchain development. He worked on OS/400 operating system kernel engineering for Linux guest partition device drivers, Linux kernel virtual IO device drivers, and GNU toolchain development for the Power Architecture (focused principally on glibc). During that time he started the IBM Advance Toolchain project for Linux on Power as a GNU Toolchain integration testbed and end-user product, created Libdfp (the ISO C Decimal Floating Point math library), co-authored the Power Architecture 32-bit ELF ABI, acted as glibc powerpc platform maintainer, and led a globally remote development team in tasks related to Power Architecture platform enablement and optimization on GNU/Linux system libraries. At Linaro he works on GNU toolchain development for the Arm architecture.
