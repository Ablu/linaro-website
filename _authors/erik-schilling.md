After starting off in C# development, I helplessly kept sinking down the stack, designed some embedded-Linux software for agricultural machinery and eventually landed here.\
In my spare time I am doing CTFs together with our hacking team that we founded at university, go running or make sure that nobody cuts their fingers off during our local workshop's office hours.
