The Linaro virtualization team has achieved many of its goals, and undergone a number of recent staffing changes resulting in a reorganisation to align the remaining work more closely with its proponents or logical maintainer.

In summary:
- KVM work has migrated to Arm
- Xen work is being managed within the LEG team
- QEMU work is now part of the toolchain team
