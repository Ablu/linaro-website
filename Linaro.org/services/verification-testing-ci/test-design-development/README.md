# Test Design and Development 

Linaro Developer Services provides services to design and develop tests to use during product development. We will design tests to ensure a feature or functionality is correctly implemented and meets its required performance characteristics. Tests designed by Developer Services are verified to work as expected, and meet our customers  documentation and code quality expectations. Tests can be integrated into a LAVA environment or into a custom test harness as required.
