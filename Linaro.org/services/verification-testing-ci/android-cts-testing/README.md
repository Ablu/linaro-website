# Android CTS Testing

Android CTS runs on a desktop machine and executes test cases directly on attached devices or an emulator. It is a set of unit tests designed to be integrated into the daily workflow (such as via a continuous build system) of the engineers building an Android device. The itention is to reveal incompatibilities early on, and ensure that the software remains compatible with other Android systems throughout the development process.

Linaro has integrated CTS into its build automation and CI infrastructure. Linaro Developer Services can offer automated CTS testing to its clients using its services around AOSP and Android.
