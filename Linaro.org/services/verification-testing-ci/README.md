# Verification, Testing & Continuous Integration (CI) 

Verification is essential to ensure robust code. It is an ongoing process involving multiple teams at Linaro and covers four key areas:

- Device Automation
- Build Automation
- Test Planning
- Developer feedback

All of the projects Linaro Developer Services takes on will involve verification and testing. This is so we can be confident that we are enabling you to produce products of the highest possible standard.
