# LAVA Integration

Linaro has developed an automated testing system called LAVA (Linaro Automated Validation Architecture) which delivers device automation and result collection. The software for this system is open source and can be recreated by following the documentation. 

Linaro Developer Servicesâ€™ engineers provide services to aid you in setting up your own LAVA lab. We can also assist with adding boards into an existing LAVA deployment.
