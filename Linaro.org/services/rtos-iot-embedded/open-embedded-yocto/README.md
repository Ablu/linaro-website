# OpenEmbedded/Yocto

Linaro Developer Services works on, and supports, OpenEmbedded layers (modular collections of packages that combine to provide a fully customized embedded Linux OS). Layers we specialise in, include those that provide board support, custom packages and  manage overall integration of layers to provide a custom distribution. Upon successful development and delivery of the various layers, Linaro Developer Services can provide an ongoing maintenance contract for the layers if desired.	


As well as managing OpenEmbedded layers, we can also provide extensive training for OpenEmbedded/Yocto.
