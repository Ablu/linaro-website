# Zephyr

Linaro is a platinum member of the Zephyr Project. Linaro Developer Services provides clients with Zephyr porting and hardware enablement services. All ports include the fundamental drivers needed to start developing applications, as well as  all board specific build files together with FLASH and UART drivers. We can submit them to the upstream Zephyr project to simplify future maintenance and OS upgrades as required. Linaro Developer Services can also enable additional hardware needed for project success, such as I2C, SPI, BLE, WiFi, USB and ethernet. Other services we offer include integrating the mcuboot secure bootloader and JTAG/SWD debug support into our customers development flow.
