# RTOS, IoT and Embedded 

We develop for a wide range of embedded devices. 
We have worked in Zephyr and mbed to support tiny IoT devices that can only run an RTOS, as well as supported larger and more powerful devices that run a Linux distribution like OpenEmbedded or Yocto.  One of our Team Leads in Developer Services is currently the Linaro representative to the Advisory Board for Yocto.
