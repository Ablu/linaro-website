# Bootloaders

We have extensive experience developing and maintaining bootloaders for a variety of boards that boot embedded Linux or AOSP. The team has developed and maintains a number of ports of ARM Trusted Firmware, UEFI and U-Boot.  These ports lay the foundations for the development of a secure boot process from initial power on, through to the loading of the operating system kernel.
