# Security

Linaro specialises in providing security to ARM Open Source Linux distributions and delivering high quality secure products across the ARM Open Source ecosystem. The Linaro Security Working Group (SWG) was created to reduce fragmentation of implementations underpinning security within ARM based systems. 

SWG works with TEE/TrustZone, Boot (ARM Trusted Firmware, UEFI and U-Boot), Digital Rights Management, IoT Security (Cortex-M series and ARMv8-M) and Kernel Hardening. Linaro Developer Services works closely with SWG and as such in a unique position to provide expertise and guidance on security topics relating to ARM. We can review your safety, compliance and security requirements. We can also conduct a risk analysis and develop a strategy for creating compliant and certified systems. 

The TEE framework was recently accepted in the Linux Kernel thanks to the hard work of the Linaro Security Working Group.This is significant because it means the code has been scrutinized by kernel maintainers and as such, maintains a very high standard. It also enables SoC vendors and OEMâ€™s to pull (official) patches from a single tree.
