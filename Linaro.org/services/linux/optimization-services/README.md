# Optimization Services

Linaro Developer Services has extensive experience in helping clients improve their existing tools and infrastructure through optimization and automation. 

Our close working relationship with ARM and the Open Source Community enables us to provide invaluable expertise and insight to ensure you get the maximum level of performance from your products. 

The Linaro Developer Services team has worked ondone a range of extensive optimization projects work for customers, covering everything from.  Optimization work ranges from memory size optimizations for restricted memory devices, to, power usage optimizations in the kernel, boot time optimizations for set top boxes and, as well performance optimizations in libraries like libc.

From power management to tuning services for IPA and EAS or boot time optimization, we work hard to ensure maximum performance, and can point to several projects where we have successfully achieved this. For the 96Boards product HiKey XX, we maximised performance by keeping the SoC within safe thermal envelope. And thanks to through the results from the Linaro Mobile Groupâ€™s lead project on size optimization of Android, we have been able to help several members further optimize their products. 

We also provide system analysis. As part of this review, we will identify the offending drivers preventing the system from reaching low power states or unnecessarily waking up the system. We will then enable power management awareness when developing software IP and debug kernel and PSCI interaction.
