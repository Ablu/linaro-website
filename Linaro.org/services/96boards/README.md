# 96Boards 

In 2015, Linaro launched 96Boards, a range of specifications with boards and peripherals offering different performance levels and features in a standard footprint. 96Boards aims to make the latest ARM-based processors available to developers at a reasonable cost. The specifications are open and define a standard board layout for SoC-agnostic (processor independent)  development platforms that can be used by developers and makers. To find out more about 96Boards, see the [96Boards website](https://www.96boards.org).
