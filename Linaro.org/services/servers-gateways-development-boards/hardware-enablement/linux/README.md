# Linux
The team can also develop and support several Linux distributions on a variety of platforms. This includes bootloader and Linux kernel ports, as well as integration into various distributions. Not only does the team have experience porting and maintaining the Linux kernel, but several of our members are in fact maintainers themselves. Linaro Developer Services has done extensive optimization work for customers. Optimization is also an area where Linaro Developer Services can help. Our work covers everything from memory size optimizations for restricted member devices, power usage optimizations in the kernel, boot time optimizations for set top boxes, to performance optimizations in libraries like libc.
