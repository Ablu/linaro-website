# OS and Distribution Integration

Linaro Developer Services specialises in distribution integration in two particular areas; AOSP and Android, and Linux and Debian. In both instances we offer:

- BSP development and customization
- Third party software integration
- Boot time performance analysis and optimization
- Security management
- Long term support and maintenance

We have extensive experience developing, porting and maintaining AOSP,  dpkg based distributions like Debian and Ubuntu, RPM based distributions like CentOS and RedHat, and embedded distributions like OpenEmbedded and Yocto on a variety of platforms.  We tailor our services to provide long term maintenance and support for these and other platforms.

Linaro Developer Services also provide complete BSP development and customization.  Our services can include bootloader ports, custom Linux kernels and integration of third party software and devices into the BSP. 

We have worked extensively on optimization projects, covering everything from memory size optimizations for restricted memory devices, power usage optimizations in the kernel, boot time optimizations for set top boxes and performance optimizations in libraries like libc.
