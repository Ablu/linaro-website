# Optimization Services

Linaro Developer Services has extensive experience in helping clients improve their existing tools and infrastructure through optimization and automation. 

Our close working relationship with ARM and the Open Source Community enables us to provide invaluable expertise and insight to ensure you get the maximum level of performance from your products. 

The team has worked on a range ofoptimization projects for customers, covering everything frommemory size optimizations for restricted memory devices, to power usage optimizations in the kernel, boot time optimizations for set top boxesand performance optimizations in libraries like libc.

From power management to tuning services for IPA and EAS or boot time optimization, we work hard to ensure maximum performance, and can point to several projects where we have successfully achieved this. For the 96Board product HiKey XX, we maximised performance by keeping the SoC within safe thermal envelope. And thanks to the results from the Linaro Mobile Groupâ€™s lead project on size optimization of Android, we have helpedseveral members further optimize their products. 

We also provide system analysis. As part of this review, we will identify the offending drivers preventing the system from reaching low power states or unnecessarily waking up the system. We will then enable power management awareness when developing software IP and debug kernel and PSCI interaction.
