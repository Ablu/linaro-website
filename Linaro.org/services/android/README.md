Linaro Developer Services develops, ports and maintains Android on a variety of platforms. This includes bootloader ports, implementations of fastboot and the Linux kernel, and changes to the Android HAL to support the hardware. The Linaro Mobile group has done extensive work to optimize Android for restricted memory devices, work which Linaro Developer Services has been able to leverage for several customersâ€™ devices.By developing and upstreaming BSP support for the HiKey and HiKey960 96Boards, Linaro has played an instrumental part in enabling Google to develop community board support in AOSP.
