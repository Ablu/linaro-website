# Automation and Continuous Integration (CI)

The Automation and CI team is comprised of Builds and Baselines, LAVA Software, LAB, and QA teams. Our mission is to engineer world class continuous integration systems through collaboration, that can be leveraged by Linaro, our members, and the community.

#### The group is solely responsible for two key lead projects and shares responsibility for a third:

- [LAVA](http://www.linaro.org/projects/lava/)
- [Kernel-CI](http://kernelci.org/)
- [Reference Platforms](https://www.linaro.org/projects/reference-platforms/)
