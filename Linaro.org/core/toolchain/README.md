# Toolchain

The toolchain working group deals with all aspects of system-level tools â€“ the core development toolchain (compiler, assembler, linker, debugger), emulation, profiling and analysis (oprofile, performance events) and instrumentation (ftrace).
Our main focus is the following projects. We work directly with upstream communities: GCC, Binutils, GDB, glibc, LLVM, QEMU.

In Q2, 2015, the toolchain team has produced (backports, new development, bug fixes, release
and validation) two new stable toolchains, 2015.02 and 2015.05. GNU 5.1 toolchains is also in
progress and the team has provided an engineering sample of a 5.1 toolchain and expects a full
release to follow with the 2015.08 stable toolchain release. Though much of the team focuses on
GNU efforts, the team has also been materially improving the LLVM ecosystem and we have a
working LLDB and LLD implementations.
