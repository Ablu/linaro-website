# Open Source Security
The Open Source Security Project (OSSP) is the main focus for Linaro's [Security Working Group (SWG)](https://www.linaro.org/core/security/).

In June 2017, the main elements of this project included kernel hardening, GlobalPlatform adaptations, TEE/TrustZone based open source trusted OS, security support for mcuboot in [LITE](https://www.linaro.org/groups/lite/), and power management in a secure environment.
