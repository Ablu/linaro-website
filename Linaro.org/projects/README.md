# Lead Projects

Linaro is a large engineering organization with many complex projects that map across various teams and groups, but there are a number of high-level projects that stand out and attract the most attention. These projects are highlighted in this section: ARMv8, Digital Home, Mobile & Android, Networking, Server, and Test & Validation. Each of these sections ultimately links to a page on the Linaro wiki for more information. You may find that you want to dive deeper and so we have also collected together some more detailed topics in the tag cloud below and these take you straight to the best place to find out more.
