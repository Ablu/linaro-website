# Lead Projects

Linaro is a large engineering organization with many complex projects that map across various teams and groups. Core and Vertical Segment Engineering groups have a limited number of Lead Projects that focus their collaboartive work. In addition to Lead Projects, some of Linaro's output may result in the creation of an open source project, an API, hardware specifications or there may be higher level project areas that people regularly search for - this work is detailed in the [Initiatives](http://www.linaro.org/initiatives/) section of this website.
