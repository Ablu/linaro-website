# OP-TEE

### Introduction

OP-TEE stands for Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment. The project has roots in a proprietary solution, initially created by ST-Ericsson and then owned and maintained by STMicroelectronics. In 2014, Linaro started working with STMicroelectronics to transform the proprietary TEE solution into an open source TEE solution instead. In September 2015, the ownership was transferred to Linaro. Today it is one of the key security projects in Linaro, with several of Linaro’s members supporting and using it.

The optee_os git, contains the source code for the TEE in Linux using the ARM® TrustZone® technology. This component meets the GlobalPlatform TEE System Architecture specification. It also provides the TEE Internal core API v1.1 as defined by the GlobalPlatform TEE Standard for the development of Trusted Applications.
