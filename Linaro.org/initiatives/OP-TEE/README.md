# OP-TEE

### Introduction

OP-TEE is an open source project which contains a full implementation to make up a complete Trusted Execution Environment. The project has roots in a proprietary solution, initially created by ST-Ericsson and then owned and maintained by STMicroelectronics. In 2014, Linaro started working with STMicroelectronics to transform the proprietary TEE solution into an open source TEE solution instead. In September 2015, the ownership was transferred to Linaro. Today it is one of the key security projects in Linaro, with several of Linaro’s members supporting and using it.
