## What is GDPR?
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is the name for new data protection legislation that will come into effect across the EU (and for any companies who hold information about EU citizens) on the 25th of May 2018.

The legislation will impact all types of website that collect, store, or process information about individuals - whether they are employees, job candidates, employees of our partners, contractors, or anyone else.

## Is Linaro GDPR compliant?

At Linaro we have updated our sites to enable us and you to be GDPR compliant.

This is an ongoing process that will allow us to meet our obligations as data processors as well as putting in place processes, where applicable, to help the people we interact with (i.e.you) to meet their obligations.
