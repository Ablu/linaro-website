          Maintaining Secure and Up to Date Android Devices
        </h3>
        <p class="pHero">
          There are millions of Android devices all over the world that need to
          be kept secure and up to date. But how do you make that happen? Linaro
          has been active in the Android community for many years, specialising
          in getting security patches and features upstreamed so that the
          community as a whole can benefit. Equally crucial to ensuring Android
          devices are secure and up to date is the regular testing of upstream
          kernels. Linaro created the testing framework which is used to do just
          this - Linux Kernel Functional Test (LKFT). Linaro runs regular tests
          of upstream kernels with AOSP and creates regression reports to the
          community, authoring fixes to specific issues which are then passed
          along to the correct community to take action.
