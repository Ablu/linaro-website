  Linaro’s work is at the heart of all modern Linux-based devices running on Arm
  processors, including Android smartphones and tablets. As markets for Arm
  processors develop, new opportunities for collaborative engineering are
  created around Linux and other open source operating systems. This has
  resulted in Linaro’s collaborative engineering spanning a wide range of
  technologies. To find out more about what work we do in each vertical, click

            Linaro was formed to consolidate foundational Arm software. Over the
            years, Linaro has entered new verticals as and when collaborative
            engineering has been needed to enable new markets on Arm
            architecture.

            Linaro engineers work together with member company engineers on Arm
            software. Strategy and roadmaps are developed in technical steering
            committees which then decide what engineering work needs to happen
            when.
