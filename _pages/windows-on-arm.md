  title: Windows on Arm Project
  description: |
    Linaro, Arm, Microsoft and Qualcomm are working
    together to build a Windows on Arm ecosystem
    which supports native development. We believe
    native development is key to unlocking better user
    experiences and broader adoption of Windows on
    Arm platforms.

            The work we do to grow the Arm open source ecosystem for Windows
            involves setting up CI

            and testing, coordinating with vendors to analyze and fix regressions and establishing

            relationships with project maintainers. Below you will find all the projects we are currently

            working on along with projects we plan to enable for Windows on Arm in the future.
