          text: >
            Linaro membership allows you to shape the future
            of Arm software together with Linaro and other
            industry leaders. Collaborating on common
            projects significantly reduces software
            fragmentation across the many Arm platforms,
            enabling participating companies and the
            community to reduce their costs for development
            and validation of Arm-based software.
