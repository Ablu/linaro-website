            Linaro employees are all over the globe, representing 26 countries.
            90% of our staff work from home and we do also offer remote, agile
            and flexible working for our office-based employees. We believe
            flexible working promotes a better work life balance - greater
            ability to focus with fewer distractions, more time for family and
            friends, cost and time savings and as a result, higher levels of
            motivation. The fact that the majority of our employees work from
            home also allows us to maintain a smaller carbon footprint.

            Linaro is committed to making a meaningful contribution to the
            communities where we work and live. As part of our corporate social
            responsibility, we have therefore implemented two paid voluntary
            days per year for each staff member to go and volunteer in his or
            her local area. We feel this improves employees’ engagement and
            well-being, helps to develop individuals’ soft skills and allow
            employees to feel they are giving something back to the community.
