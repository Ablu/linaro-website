              The Linaro Edge and Fog Computing group (LEDGE) and its members have
              joined forces to make hybridization a reality through two major efforts:

              - Trusted Substrate - a BIOS that brings standards-based secure booting and over-the-air (OTA) updates to the most trust-demanding embedded computing projects such as automotive and robotics.
              - LEDGE Reference Platform - a lightweight highly secure and robust container runtime environment that has dependable boot and update capabilities.

              The Windows on Arm project aims to establish a healthy self-sustaining
              Arm open source ecosystem for Windows. This involves looking at a
              diverse set of tools, languages and frameworks and working to ensure
              these run natively on Windows on Arm. The ultimate goal is to work with
              Microsoft, Arm, Qualcomm and the open source community to establish
              Windows on Arm as a first-class deliverable.
