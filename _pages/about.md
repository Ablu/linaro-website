            Linaro works across a wide range of software platforms and Industry
            segments. Our goal is to make it easier for companies to work with,
            and leverage, Arm open source software. 


            We do this in multiple ways:


            # Membership

            While the working groups work on non-differentiating technology that all participating companies can benefit from, other companies may simply want help building, deploying and maintaining their products.
