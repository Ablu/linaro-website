            Linaro has driven open source software development on Arm since its foundation in 2010, providing the tools, Linux kernel quality and security needed for a solid foundation to innovate on. At the time, multiple companies were frequently trying to upstream the same code, causing fragmentation and delay to product deployments. Linaro was therefore formed to consolidate the Arm code base and provide a much needed collaborative forum for companies to work together on foundational open source software on Arm.

            As a collaborative forum, Linaro is not just the place where Arm software is consolidated, developed and maintained. We also bring companies together to identify business opportunities and enable new markets on Arm architecture. This has resulted in multiple Linaro groups focused on specific verticals, including Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Vehicles, Consumer, Datacenter & Cloud, Edge & Fog Computing and IoT & Embedded.
