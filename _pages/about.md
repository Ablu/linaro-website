            As technology has evolved, so has Linaro. While we continue to help
            maintain and evolve the Arm software ecosystem through the work we
            do on toolchains, security and continuous integration testing, we
            also work in several technologies and verticals to enable Arm
            technology. These include [Artificial
            Intellgence](https://www.linaro.org/artificial-intelligence/),
            [Android Ecosystem](https://www.linaro.org/android-ecosystem/),
            Datacenter and Cloud, [Edge & Fog
            Computing](https://www.linaro.org/trusted-substrate/) and [IoT and
            Embedded](https://www.linaro.org/iot-and-embedded/). 


            There are multiple ways of engaging with Linaro, [Linaro membership](https://www.linaro.org/membership/) being one of them. If you are interested in leveraging Linaroâ€™s Arm software expertise on your project, go to www.linaro.org/services to speak to [Linaro Developer Services](https://www.linaro.org/services/). 


            Alternatively, if you just want to access any of the work we do in the open, go to [www.linaro.org/downloads](https://www.linaro.org/downloads/).
