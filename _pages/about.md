            Linaro was founded in 2010 and since its inception it has driven open source software development on Arm. Linaro provides the tools, Linux kernel quality and security needed for a solid foundation to innovate on. At the time, multiple companies were frequently trying to upstream the same code, causing fragmentation and delay to product deployments. Linaro was therefore formed to consolidate the Arm code base and provide a much-needed collaborative forum for companies to work together on foundational open source software on Arm. Today these same principles of collaboration still apply, except we now work across a breadth of Engineering specialisms within many different verticals. Our [membership](/membership/) base is diverse and includes some of the most prominent names within the industry. However, our principles of eliminating duplication of effort, reducing fragmentation and aiding speed to market remain at the core of our business.

            As a collaborative forum, Linaro is not just the place where Arm software is consolidated, developed and maintained. We also bring companies together to identify business opportunities and enable new markets on Arm architecture. This has resulted in multiple Linaro groups focused on specific verticals, including Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Vehicles, Consumer, Datacenter & Cloud, Edge & Fog Computing and IoT & Embedded.

            Linaro is member driven. Member engineers’ work with Linaro engineers to solve common software problems. Member companies also sit on technical steering committees where they collectively make decisions, together with Linaro and other members, on what work needs to be done and when. Being a Linaro member in eﬀect means shaping the future of Arm software. In addition to Linaro membership, companies can also leverage Linaro Arm software expertise on speciﬁc projects by working with Linaro Developer Services.
