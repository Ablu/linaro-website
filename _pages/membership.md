            ## Linaro Membership

            Being a Linaro member means collaborating on projects which help enable new markets on Arm and solve
            common problems. Collaboration significantly reduces software fragmentation across the many Arm
            platforms, enabling participating companies and the community to reduce their costs for development and
            validation of Arm-based software.

            **In practise, there are two parts to being a Linaro member.** 

            One part is the technical discussions with Linaro and other industry leaders in which roadmaps
            and strategy are developed and agreed.

            The other part is the collaborative engineering which then takes place between Linaro, member
            engineers and the open source community to deliver these solutions.

            **In this sense what we offer is unique** - a forum where actual software engineering happens as a result of
            member companies collaborating with Linaroâ€™s Arm software experts, other industry leaders and the open
            source community.

            ## What is the value of becoming a Linaro member?

            While the level of influence a member company has varies, depending on what membership type they have,
            all members benefit from three key factors.
