Open source will play an essential part in bringing smart, connected, always up to date and secure software to vehicles and transportation systems.  
Whilst a lot of this software exists, bringing it together into a system comprising entertainment and safety critical subsystems is a big task, essentially a retooling of software in automotive.

The Arm ecosystem is fast and adaptable and, as it engages with the future automotive industry, it will bring complex and innovative hardware and software together.  Linaroâ€™s aim is to provide a collaborative space that will allow the automotive industry, from equipment suppliers to automotive manufacturers to work on common problems.
