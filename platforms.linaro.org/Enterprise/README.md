# Enterprise Reference Platforms

The enterprise reference platform is targeted to accelerate the high powered ARMv8 servers in both datacenter and cloud vertical markets. Unified firmware and Linux kernel are provided for all the supported platforms, simplifying software maintenance and deployment. The high level components such as Openstack, Ceph, Hadoop, and KVM are rigorously validated for each distribution. The enterprise software stack provides two builds based on Debian and Centos. The goal is to help bridge the gap between older technology present in todayâ€™s distributions and the latest ARM server optimizations. 

## Features
 - Unified Linux Kernel
 - Open Boot Firmware
 - Debian and Centos Installers
 - Openstack and Ceph Reference Deployments
