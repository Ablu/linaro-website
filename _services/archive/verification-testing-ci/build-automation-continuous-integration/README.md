# Build Automation and Continuous Integration (CI)

Linaro has a team dedicated to Build Automation and CI. Every time code is pushed to a repository, we build and test the software in that repository to ensure it lives up to our high standards.  Linaro Developer Services uses this system in its projects to ensure the highest possible quality is maintained. We provide services to aid our clients to deploy their own solution for build automation and continuous integration on your premises.
