# UEFI

Linaro Developer Services has provided several of its clients with upstreamed ports of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). These ports are based on the EDKII UEFI reference implementation.
 
All ports feature the low level initialization of the non-secure world, as well as the addition of drivers to initialize and use the various hardware (UFS, eMMC, USB, etc) present on the device and boards needed by the bootloader. Also supported are EFI applications for fastboot and PXE.
