# Linux kernel

Linaro is consistently listed as one of the top five company contributors, worldwide, to Linux kernels since 3.10. Contributions go through cycles and Linaro was ranked #1 in Kernel 4.9 due to a block of contributions developed as part of project Ara. Linaro currently has over 25 kernel maintainers on staff.
 
Linaro makes contributions that cannot easily be accessed elsewhere - examples include core scheduler development, thermal and power management, EAS tuning and optimization. Being part of Linaro means Linaro Developer Services can access this specialist knowledge and provide expert advice. 

Developer Servicesâ€™ engineers have a wide variety of experience in the kernel. We can help you develop a device tree description of your hardware, as well as design, develop and debug the core kernel and a wide variety of device drivers for specific peripherals. We can also assist with upstreaming your kernel. Our engineers are experts at analyzing kernel code, breaking it into topic branches and refactoring the code to meet upstream standards. We are adept at managing the code submission and review process, ensuring submitted code is actually ready for submission before being sent and teaching your engineers how to prepare and send the code to the mailing list. Developer Services engineers effectively teach you how to interact with the kernel maintainers.
