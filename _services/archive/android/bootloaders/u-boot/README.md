# U-Boot
	
We also have experience in providing clients with upstreamed ports of U-Boot.
 
All ports feature the low level initialization of the non-secure world, as well as the addition of drivers to initialize and use the various hardware devices (UFS, eMMC, USB, etc) required by the bootloader.  Also supported in U-Boot is the fastboot protocol.
