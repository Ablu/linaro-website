# OP-TEE
OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment) is Linaro's implementation of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) as defined by the Open Mobile Terminal Platform (OMTP) and based on [specifications published by the GlobalPlatform association](https://www.globalplatform.org/mediaguidetee.asp).

OP-TEE has its roots in a proprietary solution, initially created by ST-Ericsson and then owned and maintained by STMicroelectronics. Today OP-TEE is managed and maintained by the Linaro Security Working Group (SWG).  It is is the front-running open source alternative to various other proprietary TEE solutions in the ARM ecosystem.
