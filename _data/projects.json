However, the SCMI perf-domain protocol isn't really limited to CPUs, but fits well for other generic peripheral devices too. Extended support avoids the need for SoC specific protocols/interfaces, while scaling performance for non-CPU devices.<br><br>The Linux kernel already has generic support for DVFS (Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling), through a mixture of subsystems/libraries. Without going into details, it should be possible to tap into the existing infrastructures, to add support for the SCMI perf-protocol. In this way, the support would be generic and nicely abstracted from lower layer drivers/subsystems.",
