That includes the application processor (AP)  on which we can have both rich OS like Linux but also a TEE like OP-TEE.<br>Each client of the power coprocessor has its own access point with specific control permissions on the power resources. But on some \u201cmedium/small\u201d systems, the power coprocessor may not be present or doesn\u2019t provide enough access points. In such a case, the AP itself has to control and filter the access to the power resources.<br>For security reason, the TEE must have the control of shared resources and populate the authorized resources to the non secure world. The TEE acts as a power coprocessor from Linux PoV and we can keep the SCMI interface.",
