       A little less than a year ago I began my internship with Linaro. This internship was the last thing I had to do before graduating, and those six months were the time where I learned the most about Software Engineering, Machine Architectures and Infrastructure. Linaro's employees' expertise is renowned all over the Arm world, and by working with them, one cannot help but gain more knowledge, understanding and experience. With my internship over, so was my Masters Degree, and I had the immense pleasure of having a full-time position as an Engineer proposed to me. As soon as my university allowed, I started working full-time on multiple and various projects, which I had the privilege to have some influence on. Solving bugs, adding new features and driving the projects forward is my every day routine, and I love it !

       A year ago, I was a Software Engineering Intern at Linaro. Through my internship I was able to find a practical application for the theory I had been learning at University. During my time as an Intern I created a facial recognition demo, and by the end of my internship I discovered the huge satisfaction of developing and completing a project. As I didn't have a background in Neural Networks at the time, I realised the joy of learning and diving deep into a topic on my own instead of following a lecturers lesson plan. More recently I started as a Software Engineer full-time at Linaro after finishing university in may. As a member of the 96Boards team in Linaro I've had the opportunity to work in many topics which interest me, such as self driving cars and neural networks which has been very fulfilling.
