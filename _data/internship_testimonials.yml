       A year ago, I was a Software Engineering Intern at Linaro. Through my internship I was able to find a practical application for the theory I had been learning at University. During my time as an Intern I created a facial recognition demo, and by the end of my internship I discovered the huge satisfaction of developing and completing a project. As I didn't have a background in Neural Networks at the time, I realised the joy of learning and diving deep into a topic on my own instead of following a lecturers lesson plan. More recently I started as a Software Engineer full-time at Linaro after finishing university in may. As a member of the 96Boards team in Linaro I've had the opportunity to work in many topics which interest me, such as self driving cars and neural networks which has been very fulfilling.
