bio: >
  I spent 13 years working for STMicroelectronics and led the set top box software teams on a variety of CPU architectures and OS. This involved developing and supporting linux-based multimedia software as a basis for several million embedded consumer boxes. Prior to ST, I variously worked in the Sony plant in Wales that now manufacturers the Raspberry Pi, lectured in Computer Science and designed studio equipment at the BBC.
