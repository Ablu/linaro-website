This presentation will give an overview of what Arm is doing to develop the HPC ecosystem, with a particular focus on SVE.  It will include a brief synopsis of both the commercial and open-source tools and libraries that Arm is developing and a description of the various community initiatives that Arm is involved in.  The bulk of the talk will describe the roadmap for SVE compiler support in both GCC and LLVM.  It will cover the work that has already been done to support both hand-optimised and automatically-vectorised code, and the plans for future improvements.
