Sharing build procedures of Open Source Software (OSS) is critical to quick OSS deployment. It is difficult for us because our target architecture is Arm and the public know-hows are not abundant since Arm based HPC machines are not prevalent. We will share the lessons learned from our evaluation of EasyBuild, which facilitates formulation and sharing of build recipes.
