As a part of the evaluation of Post-K’s compilers, we have been investigating compiled codes of vectorizable kernel loops in a particle-in-cell simulation program. This talk will reveal how the latest version of LLVM compiler (v1.4) works on the loops together with the qualitative and quantitative comparison with the code generated by Intel’s compiler for KNL.
