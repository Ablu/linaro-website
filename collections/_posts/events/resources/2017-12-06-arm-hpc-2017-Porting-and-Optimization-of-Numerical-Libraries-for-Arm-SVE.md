    Toshiyuki Imamura is currently a team leader of Large-scale Parallel Numerical Computing Technology at Advanced Institute for Computational Science (AICS), RIKEN. He is in charge of the development of numerical libraries for the post-K project. His research interests include high-performance computing, automatic-tuning technology, eigenvalue computation (algorithm/software/applications), etc. He and his colleagues (Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) team) were nominated as one of the finalists of Gordon Bell Prize in SC05 and SC06. He is a member of IPSJ, JSIAM, and SIAM.

RIKEN and Fujitsu are developing Arm-based numerical libraries optimized with the new feature of Arm-SVE. We present porting status of netlib+SSL-II for Arm-SVE and other OSS. Also, we demonstrate some optimization policies and techniques, especially for the basic numerical linear algebra kernels.
