Scalasca is a standardized toolset for parallel applications to evaluate their performance on HPC systems. In this talk, starting from the general introduction to the toolset, weâ€™ll review the current state of Scalasca, focusing on the arm64 support. As of today Scalasca just works out of the box on arm64, except sampling mode support which is only available on x86 systems. The on-going porting work to address this missing feature is presented in detail and also a major upgrade to their trace format called Online Trace Format (OTF) is summarized. As time permits, project outlook and demo slides actually carried on a Cavium ThunderX system will be given in the talk.
