## Anything as a Service (XaaS)

XaaS is the delivery of a vast array of cloud-based services over remote access. Products, tools and technologies are delivered as services using a flexible consumption model.

Well known examples include:

- disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS)
- containers as a service (CaaS)
- network as a service (NaaS)
- database as a service (DBaaS)
- storage as a service (STaaS)
- desktop as a service (DaaS)
- monitoring as a service (MaaS)
- function as a service (FaaS)

However, XaaS can encompass almost any service delivery including healthcare, professional services and bespoke services.
