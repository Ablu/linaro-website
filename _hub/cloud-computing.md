  ## Cloud computing

  When you use an app on your phone, the resources, such as memory and compute, you need to run that app are provided by your phone. At its simplest, cloud computing simply means that those resources are provided by something other than your phone. The resources are accessed over a network and do not exist locally.

  In practice, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet. Typically, the resources exist in server farms, are extensible, and are metered based on use. 

  Different flavours of cloud computing exist:

  ### Public cloud

  Hardware, software and supporting infrastructure is owned and operated by a cloud provider. The provider delivers computing resources like servers and storage over the internet. Typically, services are accessed and managed through a web-browser.

  ### Private cloud

  Hardware, software and supporting infrastructure is owned and operated by a business or organisation.  Cloud computing resources are used exclusively. A private cloud can be physically located on the premises of the operator or maintained by a cloud provider. 

  ### Hybrid cloud

  A hybrid cloud combines public and private cloud resources. Cloud computing resources are provided by both public and private clouds, but typically for different purposes due to technological legacy or regulatory requirements. Data and applications can be shared between the resources based on security and compliance policies.

  A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a service on public cloud infrastructure that enables the definition of a secure and discrete service delivery environment. An enterprise can define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants (users).

  A VPC is defined using virtual networking functions, notably IP addressing, and security features. Typical security measures include access and authentication, firewalls, traffic control, configuration management and monitoring. Enterprises retain much of the reassurance of a private cloud but benefit from the enhanced architecture and improved service delivery capabilities of a public cloud provider.

  ## Linaro and cloud computing

  Linaro makes significant and diverse contributions to cloud technologies such as Ceph, Rook and Open Enterprise Service Bus (EBS) as well as to infrastructure elements such as Kubernetes and OpenStack. 

  OpenEBS is just another example of Linaro’s commitment to the evolution of cloud native architecture. OpenEBS follows the Container Attached Storage (CAS) architectural model so that the storage controller and storage replicas are containerised. Service orchestrators are able to automate the management of storage and persitency both locally and in a distributed system. 

  Rook is an open source cloud native storage orchestrator providing for a diverse range of storage solutions in cloud native ecosystems. Rock transforms storage software into self-managing, self-scaling and self-healing services. It utilises underlaying services provided by cloud-native container management, scheduling and orchestration platforms.

  Rook automates:
  * deployment
  * bootstrapping
  * configuration 
  * provisioning
  * scaling
  * upgrading
  * migration
  * monitoring, and
  * resource management 

  Linaros cloud infrastructure projects are dedicated to ensuring that capabilities are easily deployed, managed and achieve optimal performance over Arm64. 

  Linaro:

  * Participates in upstreaming for Ceph, Lustre, BeeGFS and other key technologies ensuring Arm64 support and providing a common Continuous integration framework.
  * Ensures performance optimisation and performs benchmark.
  * Drives the community of partners and members to help the adoption of benchmarked storage solutions.
