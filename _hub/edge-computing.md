  ## Edge computing

  The development of Edge computing is a response to the profusion of data sources and the volume of data being generated and transported. The Internet of Things (IoT) and the realisation of 5G mobile networks ensure that the rapid increase in data seen so far will accelerate.
  The centralised architecture imposed by data centres requires that data, generated by sensors and IoT devices, is transported to the core network for processing. Similarly, responses traverse the network to peripheral devices. The centralisation of functions requires that bandwidth, storage and processing capabilities are expanded accordingly.

  However, traffic will still be imperilled by latency, bandwidth limitations and network disruption. Latency is the enemy of time-sensitive systems and undermines the promise of the IoT and Artificial Intelligence. The vision was to automate and to speed innovation by driving actionable insight from data. Vast lakes of complex data funnelled over public networks to centralised applications currently militates against the achievement of that vision.

  Edge computing is simply the distribution of hitherto centralised resources such as compute and storage to the periphery of the network: to the place where the data is generated. Local networking can overcome bandwidth limitations, network disruption and most particularly latency experienced in the wider network.

  ### Trusted substrate

  Trusted Substrateâ€™s ambition is to enable industrial grade off-the-shelf operating systems and hypervisors to run on compliant platforms without modification and complex integration. Innovations applied to various firmware and non-firmware projects will enable rapid and simplified compliance with key automotive and general Edge requirements.

  Trusted substrate encompasses various foundational technologies:

  * Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)  
  * Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0)
  * The Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment (OP-TEE)
  * Over the Air (OTA) updates leveraging Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
