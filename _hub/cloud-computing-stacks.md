  Open source software was originally used to describe software that was publicly
  accessible. It was juxtaposed to the typical proprietary code base. Only the original
  authors of proprietary software can legally copy, inspect, and alter that software.

  ## Cloud computing stacks

  Cloud services can be categorised:
    
  ### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

  An IaaS provider offers infrastructure such as servers, virtual machines, storage and operating systems.  

  ### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

  A PaaS provider offers an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. Typically, granular resource management control is available. 

  ### Software as a Service (SaaS)

  A SaaS provider offers software applications on-demand and typically on a subscription basis. Providers manage the application, infrastructure, upgrade and security patching. Users consume the service over a network on a device.  

  Serverless computing is a flavour of PaaS. Providers manage the setup, capacity planning, and server management. Serverless architecture is highly scalable and event-driven, applying resources only when a function is initiated, or a trigger event occurs. Users can focus on creating app functionality and not on managing servers and associated infrastructure.
