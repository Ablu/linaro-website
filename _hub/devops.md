  ## DevOps

  It is perhaps best thought of as a movement and philosophy that, when applied successfully, results in (or from) a change of culture, practice, and organisation. It feeds off both Lean and Agile thinking but emphasises the importance of breaking down cultural impediments to change. Its ambition is to break-down silo-thinking, focusing the organisation on the rapid continuous deployment of well-defined functionality in collaboration with the customer.

  A compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops), DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers. DevOps enables formerly siloed roles—development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security—to coordinate and collaborate to produce better, more reliable products. By adopting a DevOps culture along with DevOps practices and tools, teams gain the ability to better respond to customer needs, increase confidence in the applications they build, and achieve business goals faster.
