  ### General title

  Open source software was originally used to describe software that was publicly
  accessible. It was juxtaposed to the typical proprietary code base. Only the original
  authors of proprietary software can legally copy, inspect, and alter that software.

  Many of our engineers are maintainers on open source projects in the Arm software
  ecosystem. We are uniquely positioned to drive the conversations needed between the
  open source community and industry leaders to identify opportunities, highlight problems
  and propose solutions.

  ### Linux Kernel Quality program

  Linaro’s Linux Kernel Quality program encompasses both Linux kernel testing and testing
  of the Long Term Supported (LTS)-derived Android common kernel from the Android
  Open Source Project (AOSP).

  See project

  ### Linux Kernel Functional Testing

  Linaro’s Linux Kernel Functional Testing (LKFT) framework is a long-running project that
  provides unparalleled coverage over 6 Linux LTS releases, the linux-next branch and
  linux-mainline branches. Functional regression testing is performed in real-time over an
  array of release, architecture and target combinations.

  See project

  ### CI toolchain

  Toolchain benchmarking and analysis is a linchpin of Linaro’s Open Source toolchain
  community citizenship. It is foundational to overall toolchain quality and Continuous
  Integration (CI) efforts. The detection of code-speed regressions, code-size regressions
  and build/boot breakages helps ensure the quality and robustness of Open-Source
  toolchains.

  The toolchain CI projects aims to:
  • Secure Linaro members’ investment in toolchain optimization.
  • Contribute to the overall sustainability of the open source toolchain community.
  • Bring value to the Arm architecture ecosystem.

  For more information on this project, check out this White Paper on How to Protect
  Investment in Code Optimisation with Linaro’s Toolchain CI.

  ### Stratos

  Project Stratos is decoupling the dependencies inherent in proprietary implementations of
  hypervisors and System on a Chip (SoC). Creating open source front and back ends
  preserves the ability of manufactures to respond to innovation and maintain a cost and
  security-optimised development cycle.
