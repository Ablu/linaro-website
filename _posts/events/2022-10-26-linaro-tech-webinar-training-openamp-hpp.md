The projects will talk about progress that has been made over the last 3 years with a special focus on current work.  

**Three areas will be highlighted:**

* Upstream build and use with the Linux kernel and [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/)
* Virtio devices other than rpmsg on CPU cores that do not share a hypervisor
* System Devicetree hands-on with the [Looper tool](https://github.com/devicetree-org/lopper)

Each area will have slides, a demo, and links to resources that attendees can use to reproduce the demos on their own and try things out after the event.
