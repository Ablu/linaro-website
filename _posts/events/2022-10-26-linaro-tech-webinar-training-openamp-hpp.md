  The OpenAMP community project and Linaroâ€™s Heterogenous Processing Project are
  presenting a webinar on Tuesday 13 December.  The projects will talk about
  progress that has been made over the last 3 years with a special focus on
  current work.  


  The projects will highlight 3 areas:

  Upstream build and use with Linux and Zephyr

  Virtio devices other than rpmsg on CPU cores that do not share a hypervisor

  SystemDevicetree hands on with the Looper tool


  Each area will have slides, a demo, and links to resources that attendees can try out on their own after the event. Live Q&A will occur during the event and a Discord channel will be available for people wanting to engage afterward.
