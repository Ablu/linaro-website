  Linaro is hosting an Arm webinar: 

  Abstract: "With the growing availability of Arm-based servers, there is an increasing need for native application development - especially when migrating from another architecture. Users want to fix and optimize software quickly to provide fast, robust and cost-efficient services. Tools are key to overcome challenges of software development. During this webinar, we will introduce Arm Forge, a professional toolkit for debugging and profiling on Linux Arm servers. We will give an overview of the tools' features and demonstrate their capabilities for sequential and parallel programming."


  This webinar is open to anyone to register and is free.
