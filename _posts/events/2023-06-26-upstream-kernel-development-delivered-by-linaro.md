description: >-
  Upstream Kernel Development shows trainees how to contribute to the Linux
  kernel. Thisincludes understanding the role of kernel maintainers, how to best
  align their work withthe Linux release schedule, how to handle feedback and
  what to do if things don’t go toplan.


  This course covers the “social” aspects of upstream kernel development. It is bestsuited to trainees who understand how to write kernel drivers but have not previouslyworked alongside the wider kernel community. Trainees will learn how to confidentlyparticipate in upstream kernel development and, in particular, how to contribute newkernel drivers.
