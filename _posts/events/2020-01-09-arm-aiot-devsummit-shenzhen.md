1:10-1:40pm

Topic: Use Arm NN to accelerate and optimize the development of end-to-end AI (first half)

Main participants: Li Sicong, Arm Zhou Jie, Linaro

Main content:

Machine learning workflow includes data collection, aggregation, machine learning model training, evaluation, Fine-tuning and model deployment tasks. ARM not only provides processors that execute complex machine learning workflows locally, but also SDKs and tools for rapid application development and optimization. Services to monitor and automate end-to-end ML tasks. We will show how to use Arm NN and Arm Compute Library to accelerate and optimize segment-side AI development on Arm processors.
