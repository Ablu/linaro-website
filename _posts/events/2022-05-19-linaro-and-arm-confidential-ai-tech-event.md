Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to enable Internet of Things (IoT) devices to take actions based on pre-trained inference models. Yet challenges such as inconsistent security practises and a lack of standardisation mean there are many risks to consider - from exposure of personal data to malicious actors. Linaroâ€™s Confidential AI Project presents a way to securely deploy AI to IoT devices through open source standards.

Join us on Tuesday 28 June for our virtual Tech Day on Confidential AI. We will launch the schedule and registration at the beginning of June.
