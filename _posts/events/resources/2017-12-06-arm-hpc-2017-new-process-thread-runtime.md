New portable and practical parallel execution model, Process in Process (PiP in short) will be presented. PiP tasks share the same virtual address space like the multi-thread model and privatized variables like the multi-process model. Because of this, PiP provides the best of two worlds, multi-process (MPI) and multi-thread (OpenMP).
