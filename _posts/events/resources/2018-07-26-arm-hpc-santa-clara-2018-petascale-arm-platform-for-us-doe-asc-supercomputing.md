The Vanguard program looks to expand the potential technology choices for leadership-class High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms, not only for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) but for the Department of Energy (DOE) and wider HPC community. Specifically, there is a need to expand the supercomputing ecosystem by investing and developing emerging, yet-to-be-proven technologies and address both hardware and software challenges together, as well as to prove-out the viability of such novel platforms for production HPC workloads.

The first deployment of the Vanguard program will be Astra, a prototype Petascale Arm supercomputer to be sited at Sandia National Laboratories during 2018. This talk will focus on the arthictecural details of Astra and the significant investments being made towards the maturing the Arm software ecosystem. Furthermore, we will share initial performance results based on our pre-general availability testbed system and outline several planned research activities for the machine."
