The latest revolution in HPC interconnect architecture is the development of In-Network Computing, a technology that  enables handling and accelerating application workloads at the network level. By placing data-related algorithms on an intelligent network, we can overcome the new performance bottlenecks and improve the data center and applications performance. The combination of In-Network Computing and Arm based processors offer a rich set of capabilities and opportunities to build the next generation of HPC platforms.
