SUSE has been delivering commercial Linux support for Arm based servers since 2016. Initially the focus was on high end servers for HPC and Ceph based software defined storage. But we have enabled a number of other Arm SoCs and are even supporting the Raspberry Pi. This session will cover the SUSE products that are available for the Arm platform and view to the future.
