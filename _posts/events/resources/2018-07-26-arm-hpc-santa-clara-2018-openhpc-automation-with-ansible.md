   bio: >
    He started programming in the late 80's in C for PCs after a few years playing with 8-bit computers, but he only started programming professionally in the late 90's during the .com bubble. After many years working on Internet's back-end, he moved to UK and worked a few years on bioinformatics at EBI before joining ARM, where he worked on the DS-5 debugger and on the EDG-to-LLVM bridge, where he became the LLVM Tech Lead. Recently, he worked with large clusters and big data at HPCC before moving to Linaro.

In order to test OpenHPC packages and components and to use it as a platform to benchmark HPC applications, Linaro is developing an automated deployment strategy, using Ansible, Mr-Provisioner and Jenkins, to install the OS, OpenHPC and prepare the environment on varied architectures (Arm, x86). This work is meant to replace the existing ageing Bash-based recipes upstream while still keeping the documents intact. Our aim is to make it easier to vary hardware configuration, allow for different provisioning techniques and mix internal infrastructure logic to different labs, while still using the same recipes. We hope this will help more people use OpenHPC with a better out-of-the-box experience and with more robust results
