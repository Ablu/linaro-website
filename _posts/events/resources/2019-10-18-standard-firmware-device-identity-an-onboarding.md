title: Standard Firmware, device identity and onboarding
description: >
    Edge Computing ecosystem requires standardized firmware, a common device identity and device onboarding across processor architectures (Arm, Intel, Power, RiscV) and across processors. Those requirements are leveraging existing standards but are not merely a downsize of cloud technologies and best practices. The talk will present the use cases, the standardization efforts and open source implementation status on those topics.
