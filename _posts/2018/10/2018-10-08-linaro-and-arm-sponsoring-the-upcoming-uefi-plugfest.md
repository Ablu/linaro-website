On the firmware side, testing device interoperability with Arm servers is critical to developing the Arm infrastructure ecosystem. That is why Linaro and Arm have decided to sponsor the upcoming UEFI Plugfest and encourage Arm partners to participate. 

The UEFI Plugfest 2018 in Taipei will present a wide range of Arm 64-bit architecture servers that few have seen and less have experienced. After years of hard work in the Arm ecosystem, with Linaro and its members taking leading roles, Arm Servers have now become compelling prod]ucts for the data center market.

During UEFI Plugfest 2018, various types of Arm 64bit servers will be provided by ODM, OEM and SoC vendors in the Arm/Linaro test suite, available for all participants to test their drivers on Arm 64bit environment.
