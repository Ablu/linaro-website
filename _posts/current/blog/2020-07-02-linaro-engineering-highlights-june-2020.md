  The June 2020 Engineering Highlights this month features the Linux Kernel 5.7
  release statistics where Linaro and its engineers continue to rank in the top
  for multiple categories. We are also excited to announce a free webinar on
  July 21 reviewing Arm server profiling and debugging tools. We have a review
  of additional training available from Member Services. 


  Conference reports this month are a detailed summary of the OSPM (Power Management) Summit and EEMBC MCUboot benchmarking presentation. Additional topics include a summary of the LITE Engineering Sprint, an introduction to VirtIO, the Micro TVM project and news on dma-buf heaps.
