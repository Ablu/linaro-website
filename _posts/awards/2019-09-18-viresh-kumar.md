  Have more than 9 years of total experience in Linux Kernel development across different sub-systems. Earlier I worked with ST Microelectronics for over 6 years and was maintainer of SPEAR Platform and few drivers. Later I moved to ARM and was Linaro Assignee into PMWG and LNG for two years before I joined Linaro directly. Currently I am co-maintainer of CPUFreq Framework and have done quite some work in Core isolation with NOHz-Full.
