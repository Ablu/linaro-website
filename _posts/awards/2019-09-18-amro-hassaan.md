bio: >
  Following a passion for Software development, I switched gears from legal and media text-editing and translation to Software world. My experience ranged from Server Development for policing systems at Versaterm Inc. to Tools Development at Blackberry. IMO, exposure to multicultural work environments is a paramount recipes for success.
