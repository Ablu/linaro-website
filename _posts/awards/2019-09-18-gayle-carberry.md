bio: >
  Hi! My background is predominantly HR and Recruitment. My previous role was working within the HR Department at i2 in Cambridge. i2 was a visual analysis software company in Cambridge (now part of IBM). I took voluntary redundancy to bring up my little ones, and now that they are more independent, I have escaped back to work. I live in Ely, Cambridgeshire and love to go to different places.
