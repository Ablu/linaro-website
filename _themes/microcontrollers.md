Last are activities focused on Microcontrollers, Cortex-M and Cortex-A devices with minimal capacities. With minimal RAM, storage and CPU, inference workloads must not only fit into a small space but frameworks must also be purpose optimized for the environment. ÂµTVM and Tensorflow Lite Micro both are rapidly being developed to bring AI workloads on Microcontrollers. Collaborative activities across Linaro members are transforming these projects from early prototypes to productive environments for creating solutions.
