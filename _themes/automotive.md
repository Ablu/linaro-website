  been an important topic for Linaro since the start. Linaro has built a strong team with

    The automotive industry is entering an exciting phase through the Software Defined Vehicle
    momentum, moving more and more away from hardware upgrades to software developments. But
    there is still a long way to go before the Software Defined Vehicle becomes a reality. From the lack of
    standard interfaces and latency to the need for secure communication between virtual machines and
    the ability to maintain up-to-date, secure software - all of these challenges have one thing in common.
    They all require collaborative software engineering to bring standardization and reference open source
    code bases to automotive. Without open standards the path to delivering the software defined vehicle
    will be a lot longer and more costly.

    Linaro has a track record of bringing standardization to the Linux kernel and is now extending this to
    automotive. For more information, fill out the form below to get in touch or download our Whitepaper.
