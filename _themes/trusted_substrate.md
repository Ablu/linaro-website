    Trusted Substrate is a BIOS that brings standards based secure booting and
    over-the-air (OTA) updates to the most trust demanding embedded
    computing projects such as automotive and robotics. OTA is a key value of
    Trusted Substrate as it allows any firmware components to be updated with
    anti-bricking and anti-roll back protections, and will allow transactional
    updates in asymmetric computing, Cortex-A + Cortex-M solutions.
