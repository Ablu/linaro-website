            **Trusted Substrate** is a BIOS that brings standards based secure booting and over-the-air (OTA) updates to the most trust-demanding computing environments.
            It builds on Arm SystemReady specifications to deliver best in class solutions for industrial, automotive and telecom edge. OTA is a key value of Trusted Substrate as it allows any firmware components to be updated with anti-bricking and anti-roll back protections, and will allow transactional updates in asymmetric computing, cortex-A+cortex-M  solutions.

            **Dependable Boot**
            When exposed outside data centers, computers of all sizes are vulnerable to a whole new set of risks. Linaro Trusted Substrate aims to mitigate such threats as defined in various documents from NIST on firmware security or from the United Nations on Vehicle cybersecurity. For instance, a key aspect of a Dependable Boot process is that BIOS should behave in a deterministic manner under physical attacks such as glitching. 

            **Over-the-air updates**
            Over-the-air updates have been around for a while but this process needs to reach a degree of scalability and trust never seen before. Standard bricking and rollback protections of any updated BIOS component is a must. A key challenge is to allow full transactional updates of complex boards with heterogeneous computing,  accelerators and various micro-controllers: all firmware components must be updated to a new version or not updated at all. Last but not least, vouching for the successful update of a system (firmware, operating system, application software) should be flexible to accommodate rich policies.

            **Trust Services**
            Trusted Substrate is being developed to facilitate portable Trust Services across processor architectures and platforms. For instance, Linaro expects to reduce the cost of developing and maintaining Trust Services such as  Digital Rights Management and Digital Wallets.

            ### Is the project for me?

            If you are a product builder you may want to lead specific aspects of the ownership lifecycle, software supply chain integration or over-the-air updates for instance. Some tenders may require compliance to regulatory or industry specific trust related documentation (NIST,  UN.WP29, ASILâ€¦).
            Membership empowers you to have a strong influence on the scope of the relevant specifications that Trusted Substrate needs to cover.

            If you are an operating system provider, you may want to influence the feature and interface implementation aspects.
            Membership gives you an opportunity to push for completeness of the implementation that sometimes includes components that are optional, based on standards which may be required for your specific use cases.

            If you are a SoC vendor, you may want to ensure that all your digital trust technologies are properly exposed and that your product meets all the requirements from product builders.
            Membership gives you the opportunity to push and promote your secure element and your innovative crypto accelerators as well as silicon based hardware attack mitigations.

            If your business relies on trusted applications such as Digital Rights Management, Digital Wallet or fingerprint authentication, you may want to lead the transformation of the trusted application life cycle and lead its specification and technical roadmap.
