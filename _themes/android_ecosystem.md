            ## Android and Open Source

            For devices running on Arm-based technology to truly leverage the Arm CPUâ€™s power consumption, performance and all day battery life capabilities, it is necessary to ensure that open source tools and applications using Android can run natively on Arm. It is also essential to ensure that Android devices are continually maintained, updated and secure.

            These are no small tasks which any one company can tackle on its own. This is why companies join the Linaro Consumer Group.

            ## Maintaining Secure and Up to Date Android Devices

            There are millions of Android devices all over the world that need to be kept secure and up to date. But how do you make that happen? Linaro has been active in the Android community for many years, specialising in getting security patches and features upstreamed so that the community as a whole can benefit. Equally crucial to ensuring Android devices are secure and up to date is the regular testing of upstream kernels. Linaro created the testing framework which is used to do just this - Linux Kernel Functional Test (LKFT). Linaro runs regular tests of upstream kernels with AOSP and creates regression reports to the community, authoring fixes to specific issues which are then passed along to the correct community to take action.
