The direction of Linaro is determined by its [board of directors](http://www.linaro.org/organization/board/), formed from representatives of member companies and the CEO of Linaro. Execution of long-term objectives and delivery of nearer term development roadmaps is assigned to the [Linaro executive management team](http://www.linaro.org/organization/executive/), [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](http://www.linaro.org/organization/tsc/) and segment group steering committees. The TSC includes senior engineers from each of the Linaro member companies, a representative from each segment engineering group, plus Linaro’s CTO and VP of engineering. Under the management team and steering committees, Linaro’s engineering team is split into [Core Engineering](Linaro.org/core/README.md), [Member Services](http://www.linaro.org/member-services/) and [Segment Groups](Linaro.org/groups/README.md).
